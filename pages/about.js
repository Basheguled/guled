              Working at Confluent, I got to solve a wide array of problems. I
              created new features in our onboarding flow to improve our attach
              rate for new users. I also had the chance to independently improve
              on critical areas like our app&apos;s authentication and payment
              flows. Later on, my team specifically focused on increasing
              customer conversion and user retention by shipping UI features and
              then tracking user behaviors to decide what to ship next!

              The first half of my internship was mainly focused on analyzing
              and transforming datasets using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The
              second half (my favorite part ü§™) had me focused on frontend
              development as the team was building new global search
              functionality. That is when my love for frontend really started to
              grow ‚ù§Ô∏è
